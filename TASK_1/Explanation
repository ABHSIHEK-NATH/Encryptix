_Titanic Survival Prediction_

Challenge of the Project -> to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.

*Working of the Analysis*
1. Question or problem definition
2. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Acquire training and testing data
5. Modeling, predicting and solving the problem

//1. Question or problem definition
Using the Titanic passenger data (name, age, price of ticket, etc.) to try to predict who will survive and who will die.
While studying the data found out that is a binary classification.

Where, the values in the second column of the dataset (“Survived”) can be used to determine whether each passenger survived or not:

* if it’s a “1”, the passenger survived.
* if it’s a “0”, the passenger died.

// 2. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data
Cleaning and handling the missing values. 
* Age : Contains 177 null values out of 891 entries. Imputed with median values for Age across sets of Pclass and Gender 
feature combinations.

* Embarked : Contains 2 null values. Imputed with mode of training data.

* Fare: Contains 1 null values. Imputed with mean of training data.

* Cabin : 687 out of 891 Cabin entries are null , i.e. more than 50 % of the total data exists. 
Deck, is created because it is slightly more general than Cabin.

// 3. Exploratory Data Analysis -> Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data Analysis

-> Only 350 out of 891 passengers (38.4%) survived in the training set.

* Sex - The number of men on board the ship is much higher than the number of women, 
but the number of women saved is more than twice that of the number of males survived.
The survival rates for a women on the ship is around 75% while that for men in around 19%.

* Pclass - Passengers Of Pclass 1 has a very high priority to survive.
The number of Passengers in Pclass 3 were a lot higher than Pclass 1 and Pclass 2,
but still the number of survival from Pclass 3 is low compare to them
Pclass 1 %survived is around 63%, for Pclass2 is around 48%, and Pclass3 survived is around 25%
Sex and class are important factors for survival. Let’s determine survival rate based on sex and class together.

* Female from Upper class is about 95–96% survived. Only 3 out of 94 Women from Upper class died.
* Female Upper class has high priority to survive
* Lower class female has more survived rate than Upper class male.

Created visualization based on Survived/NotSurvived, Sex, Age, PClass, Embakation, Spouse/Sibling. 

// Ultimate Finding : According to the analysis, passengers were more likely to survive if:

* Upper class ticket
* Women/Lady
* On the contrary, being a Lower class old man lowered the chances of survival.
