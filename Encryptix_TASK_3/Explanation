*Iris Flower Classification*

-> In this Iris flower dataset there are three species: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, I have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. My objective is to train a machine 
learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.

Features Used:
1. Sepal length in cm 
2. Sepal width in cm 
3. Petal length in cm 
4. Petal width in cm

-> Data Analysis:
1. Descriptive statistics- SD, Min, Max etc .
2. Class Distribution (Species counts are balanced or imbalanced) â€“ Balanced.
3. Univariate Plots:- Understand each attribute better. 

-> Observation:
1. Using Sepal_Lenght & Sepal_Width features, we can only distinguish Setosa flower from others.
2. Seperating Versicolor & Virginica is much harder as they have considerable overlap.
3. Hence, Sepal_Lenght & Sepal_Width features only work well for Setosa.

-> Machine Learing algorithm:

Steps to implement Machine Learning
1. Import necessary Library
2. Analyzing Data 
3. Spliting the Data Set into train and test
4. Chossing right algorithm for training model
5. Test the algorithm with test data.

-> Algorithm used in this analysis:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Classification and Regression Tree(CART) 
4. Gaussion Naive Bayes(NB) 
5. K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN) 
6. Deision Tree

The results of these models are described and also compared with eachother.
